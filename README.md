# Handwritten Recognition
This project will be my first real Artificial Intelligence (AI).  A simple artificial neural network from scratch. Before we jump into ambitious libraries such as Keras, Tensorflow, and etc. I would like to learn how neural network works. For now, this will start by reading MNIST dataset files. (*.idx1-ubyte and *.idx3-ubyte)


## Prerequisites Files:
**1. Handwritten.Recognition.py</a>**
- This is the main source code of the project.

**2.	train-images.idx3-ubyte**
- The MNIST database of handwritten digits, has a training set of 60,000 examples.

**3.	train-labels.idx1-ubyte**
- This database file is the result of handwritten digits, for training of the neural network.

**4. \\.idea (Folder) \*Optional**
- This folder contains Pycharm’s files. I’ll explain down below, why I would recommend to use Pycharm by JetBrains in this project.

## Phasing of the Project:
1.	Downloading Handwritten Digits Datasets. <b>(Done.)</b>
2.	Reading the Datasets. <b>(Done)</b>
3.	This Project will be doing a Feedforward Neural Network as an artificial neural network to read the handwritten digits.
 - - 3a.	Backpropagation <b>(Ongoing: Learning the Mathematics in Feedforward Neural Network)</b>
- - 3b.	Testing the with the datasets using Feedforward Neural Network.
4.	Find more datasets to test the with code.
5.	User input and the project will automatically detect the digits. <i>(I cannot decide yet how the users will input.)</i>

Next phase will be doing <b>Backpropagation</b> for the datasets we have collected. Please feel free to contribute or send me notes especially how the formula derives.

# Tips & Tricks
I used to work with Microsoft Visual Studio for my Python projects. Now, after having a difficulty with visualizing my matrices data, I figured out that Pycharm’s has a feature that can view a matrix data into its dimension.
