# Handwritten Recognition
This project will be my first real Artificial Intelligence (AI).  A simple artificial neural network from scratch. I'll dissect it and learn how AI works. (*.idx1-ubyte and *.idx3-ubyte)


## Prerequisites Files:
**1. Handwritten.Recognition.py</a>**
- This is the main source code of the project.

**2.	train-images.idx3-ubyte**
- The MNIST database of handwritten digits, has a training set of 60,000 examples. 

    <i>Source:</i> http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

**3.	train-labels.idx1-ubyte**
- This database file is the result of handwritten digits, for training of the neural network.

    <i>Source:</i> http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

**4. \\.idea (Folder) \*Optional**
- This folder contains Pycharm’s files. I’ll explain down below, why I would recommend to use Pycharm by JetBrains in this project.

### Libraries Needed:
**1. Numpy -** http://www.numpy.org/

    python -m pip install --user numpy scipy matplotlib ipython jupyter pandas sympy nose

## Phasing of the Project:
1.	Downloading Handwritten Digits Datasets. <b>(Done.)</b>
2.	Reading the Datasets. <b>(Done)</b>
3.	This Project will be doing a Feedforward Neural Network as an artificial neural network to read the handwritten digits.
 - - 3a.	Backpropagation <b>(Ongoing: Learning the Mathematics in Feedforward Neural Network)</b>
- - 3b.	Testing the with the datasets using Feedforward Neural Network.
4.	Find more datasets to test the with code.
5.	User input and the project will automatically detect the digits. <i>(I cannot decide yet how the users will input.)</i>

Next phase will be doing <b>Backpropagation</b> for the datasets we have collected. Please feel free to fork the project and share back to me your contribution or send me notes on how the formula derives.

# Tips & Tricks
I used to work with Microsoft Visual Studio for my Python projects. Now, after having a difficulty with visualizing my matrices data, I figured out that Pycharm’s has a feature that can view a matrix data into its dimension.

<b>Pycharm Matrix Viewer:</b> This is the first matrix [28 x 28] data of the training datasets.

## Humanitarian Objective
A Math Geek, a dedicated Researcher, an enthusiast of Artificial Intelligence, an Engineer, and an Entrepreneur, I look forward to a new challenge in bringing my expertise to a new level.

Aiming to use my expertise to empower life with the use AI and Mathematics. 

Feel free to email me, my email below, if you want me to join your team, even for free. As long it is for the betterment of the world. Like beating a cancer or other superbugs, I know Kaggle has many challenges. That is why I am sharpening my skills in AI and learning its algorithm so when I enter the war, I know that I am ready. 

I also need a mentor to forge a path for my machine learning study.
