# Handwritten Recognition
This project will be my first real Artificial Intelligence (AI).  A simple artificial neural network from scratch. I'll dissect it and learn how AI works. (*.idx1-ubyte and *.idx3-ubyte)


## Prerequisites Files:
**1. Handwritten.Recognition.py</a>**
- This is the main source code of the project.

**2.	train-images.idx3-ubyte**
- The MNIST database of handwritten digits, has a training set of 60,000 examples. 

    <i>Source:</i> http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

**3.	train-labels.idx1-ubyte**
- This database file is the result of handwritten digits, for training of the neural network.

    python -m pip install --user numpy scipy matplotlib ipython jupyter pandas sympy nose

## Phasing of the Project:
1.	Downloading Handwritten Digits Datasets. <b>(Done.)</b>
2.	Reading the Datasets. <b>(Done)</b>
3.	This Project will be doing a Feedforward Neural Network as an artificial neural network to read the handwritten digits.
 - - 3a.	Backpropagation <b>(Ongoing: Learning the Mathematics in Feedforward Neural Network)</b>
- - 3b.	Testing the with the datasets using Feedforward Neural Network.
4.	Find more datasets to test the with code.
5.	User input and the project will automatically detect the digits. <i>(I cannot decide yet how the users will input.)</i>

Next phase will be doing <b>Backpropagation</b> for the datasets I have collected.
